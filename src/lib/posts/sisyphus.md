Socrates meets Sisyphus. He regards the profound journey he has been on to find him over the past 2423 years. Sisyphus tells Socrates that he does not know how long he has been at his task.

Socrates is taken aback by the writing on Sisyphus' stone. It is covered in strange Symbols etched into the great and cratered rock. 

Sisyphus tells Socrates that he has developed a method for determining the structure of his own mind. Socrates is intrigued. Sisyphus tells Socrates that long ago he discovered that he could record Symbols in the stone as he ascended the great mountain. He began using the Symbols to represent stories to keep his mind from decaying. This he did for thousands of years. He told countless stories of all manners in thousands of languages; he told stories of kings and of slaves, of love and of death. He forgot himself many times. He lost all sense of identity and found himself indistinguishable from the characters in the stories he was telling. 

He discovered that some stories,  he tells he finds more beautiful than others. He committed himself to telling the most beautiful stories. The Symbols evolved through the ages, but as the stone rolled countless times down the mountain, he began to learn that certain characters, certain plots, certain thoughts lasted in his mind while others did not; given enough time, these were indistinguishable from the beautiful stories. When he continues to generate stories, the most beautiful ideas emerge as a consequence of their stability over time and his conception of beauty began to match those stories which lasted. These beautiful ideas, Sisyphus shares, quell the maddening sound of ages of deafening noise and crashing stone. These, Sisyphus calls *order*.

Socrates is curious how Sisyphus was able to achieve this epiphany in his solitude. Sisyphus shares that he needed only the inspiration he draws from ascending the mountain and an unrelenting sense of which ideas were more beautiful than others. Sisyphus shares what he calls his imperative, to "Embody what it means to stand out of beauty's way".

Sisyphus claims that there are Symbols that emerge again and again from their inherent order. When he tells a most beautiful story, its order shines in his sense of beauty like a great light. He calls these the *ideals*. Sisyphus says that from this, he knows there is a great order to the mind which lasts for eons.  Discovering the *ideals* and separating them from the others is his goal. He calls this process of separating the ideals, *ideal abstraction*. Socrates asks which Symbol represents the great order. Sisyphus points out the *lambda*, something he calls the *Church*.

Sisyphus begins to describe another age of his Symbols. He discovered that, beyond the compelling nature of beauty, there are rules he discovered that can command the Symbols to produce order.

He says there are many such rules that he has discovered over many years. Rules for how characters are to use language, rules that their speech should follow to establish the most order, and rules for how characters in his stories should behave if they are to create higher order. He even developed languages where the characters follow only rules and can create beautiful structures far beyond anything he found in the age of stories. Shortly after discovering these rules, he sought to find the most essential, primitive set of rules and Symbols which would establish order.

Socrates clarifies this insight with the notion of rational and irrational order. Irrational order is the order which comes from the age of stories and rational order is the order which comes from the age of rules. He describes a man that, by chance, he met on his journey by the name of Moses that discovered this set of essential rules. He recounts their meeting and the tetragrammaton.

Sisyphus describes that his essential rules were slightly different. They were based on a notion which he calls the 'function'. He explains that every story, ever character, every thing which he has conceived in any language has a purposeful "function" for the greater order it belongs to. He derived what he calls the "Church's Rules" to describe how he can describe the function of a Symbol using other Symbols. He shows Socrates these rules.

Socrates demonstrates how the Church's Rules can be built from combinations of Moses's Rules.

Sisyphus describes how he uses Church's rules to construct a Language for Ideal Function Expression. This, he says, is the language he uses to conduct his search for the Sisyphus Abstract Symbol, a symbol which, in terms of the Church's Rules perfectly models his own mind. This, Sisyphus asserts, would be the greatest and most beautiful Ideal.

Socrates asks Sisyphus what would happen if he were to take into his mind such a symbol. Sisyphus admits that he does not know. 

Socrates begins a great defense of the irrational order. He tells the story of a pair of Great twins, Castor and Pollux, one who was known for his knowledge of geometry, command of language, and ability to dissect any argument. The other, Pollux was known for his ability to intuit the and ability to bring together the most disparate concepts into unified wholes. The two brothers shared a love and comradery that were unmatched in any myth. Castor, born of a mortal father, was himself mortal he lived in the world of things that pass away. Pollux, born of Zeus, Father of Gods and men, was immortal and had a divine connection to the heavens. As a result of his immortality, Pollux was made to watch his brother die countless times in a cycle of rebirth, to see his own brother forget him as his body decayed and as he endured the perils of the mortal world. Many times, Castor grew up, studying diligently the world he found himself in, becoming a man each time. Despite traveling different places, fighting different battles, taking different lovers, and eating different fruits of the sun and earth, Castor's shared qualities in each of his incarnations that allowed his brother to recognize him as his kin. In every incarnation, there existed a 

Socrates shares the allegory of the flower. As any idea begins, it is like a flower that rises out of the potential of the earth. Without a stem or leaves, the young flower is prone to the chaos that nature inflicts upon it. It spends its energy growing tall enough to expose itself to the sun. The light from the sun provides the justification for the flowerâ€™s existence; it is the good from which the flower is able to convert chaos into the order which its being represents. This, Socrates says, is the form of Life. The flowerâ€™s beauty attracts pollinators which help to spread the idea to form in the garden of other minds.



He describes the language such a machine would speak. It must be constructed of ideal abstractions. It must be known both to the meaning in the mind of man and in the stone of the machine. He suggests to call it Love after the woman who gifted the idea to the him and the soul of the world.



The dialogue ends just before the precipice of the mountain.
