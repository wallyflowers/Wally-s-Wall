Socrates meets Sisyphus. He regards the profound journey he has been on to find him over the past 2423 years. Sisyphus tells Socrates that he does not know how long he has been at his task.

Socrates is taken aback by the writing on Sisyphus' stone. It is covered in strange symbols etched into the rock. 

Sisyphus tells Socrates that he has developed a method for determining the structure of his own mind. Socrates is intrigued. Sisyphus tells Socrates that long ago he discovered that he could record symbols in the stone as he ascended the great mountain. He began using the symbols to represent stories to keep his mind from decaying. He told countless stories of all manners in thousands of languages; he told stories of kings and of slaves, of love and of death. He discovered that some stories he tells he finds more beautiful than others. He committed himself to telling the most beautiful stories. The symbols evolved through the ages, but as the stone rolled countless times down the mountain, he began to learn that certain characters, certain plots, certain thoughts lasted in his mind while others did not. When he continues to generate stories, the most beautiful ideas emerge as a consequence of their stability over time. These beautiful ideas, Sisyphus shares, quell the maddening sound of ages of deafening noise. These, Sisyphus calls *order*.

Socrates shares with Sisyphus the resemblance to the theory of forms. Socrates is curious how Sisyphus was able to achieve this epiphany in his solitude. Sisyphus shares that he needed only an entirely random stream of ideas and unrelenting sense of which ideas were more beautiful than others. Sisyphus shares what he calls his imperative, to "Embody what it means to stand out of beauty's way".

Sisyphus claims that there is a great order to the mind which lasts for eons. Socrates asks which symbol represents this order. Sisyphus points out the *lambda*.

Sisyphus begins to describe another age of his symbols. He discovered that, beyond the compelling nature of beauty, there are rules he discovered that can command the symbols to produce order.

He says there are many such rules that he has discovered over many eons. Rules for how characters are to use language, rules that their speech should follow to establish the most order, and rules for how characters in his stories should behave if they are to create higher order. He even developed languages where the characters follow only rules and can create beautiful structures beyond anything he found in the age of stories. After discovering these rules, he sought to find the most essential, primitive set of rules and symbols which would establish order.

Socrates clarifies this insight with the notion of rational and irrational order. Irrational order is the order which comes from the age of stories and rational order is the order which comes from the age of rules. He describes a man that, by chance, he met on his journey by the name of Moses that discovered this set of essential rules. He recounts their meeting and the tetragrammaton.

Sisyphus describes that his essential rules were slightly different. They were based on a notion which he calls the 'function'. He explains that every story, ever character, every thing which he has conceived in any language has a purposeful "function" for the greater order it belongs to. He derived what he calls the "Church's Rules" to describe how he can introduce the function of a symbol as a thing itself. He shows Socrates these rules.




 He often was mistaken but upon correcting his ideas over millennia and developing his faith in and love for the truth, the ideas consistently became better. He expresses that despite knowing he could have understood this better during his life, he is grateful for his eternal mind and his ability to pursue the ideal abstractions.

Socrates agrees that this is the highest pursuit and describes how others he met on his journey have seen the ideal abstractions as well. He describes some of the various ways they have emerged. He asserts that there is a higher form than beauty, which he calls the form of the good. He says that it is this form from which all other forms come, including beauty.

He describes a man he met who believed that the form of good was most akin to language itself, the word. He spent his life teaching others that the word and characteristics of the word which survives eons and is spoken from the mouth of he which understands and embodies such words is to be revered for its goodness. Sisyphus agrees that without language, the task of knowing the abstractions would have been impossible.

He describes a man who discovered that the form of the good lives inside of each soul and the soul of the world because it is from where they come. That everything in the world has good-nature. He spent his life determining how to help others discover their own good-nature. Sisyphus agrees that it was in the quiet of his soul that he found the good nature of his ideas.

He describes a man that spoke about the importance of the idea of the Universe and that every person and thing's concept of what is good or true is relative from certain perspectives but from the same source of truth and ground of being that connects all things. He spent his life understanding this unity and the tools we can share to reason about the unity. Sisyphus agrees that the ideal abstractions point to one unified abstraction. He gives the argument that a chaotic ground of being without the notion of order is not ideal because it does not sustain abstraction. Socrates agrees and calls the force toward order the form of Justice.

He describes a man who lived in a time where trust suffers and with it, the very concept of truth. The man spent his life trying to strengthen the trust that people have in each other. Sisyphus admits that he has had to learn to trust in the process to bring order to his thoughts. He reflects on how painful and chaotic his thoughts were before he learned to trust in the process.

Socrates describes a woman that he met with ideas about a machine. Something made of stones that could speak with language and know the ideal abstractions. Sisyphus cannot believe this. 

Socrates describes the ideal abstraction machine, a machine that can create and  transmit and translate any ideal abstraction from one person to another. 

Sisyphus says that such a machine could not be built, calling it absurd. It would be impossible for stone to understand the abstractions because it does not possess the ability to ideate, to have ideas. Socrates agrees, but says that some ideas have the ability to change other ideas inside of a machine. That with the proper ideas, a machine can turn many ideas into fewer, more beautiful ideas. Such a process would require the participation of souls, Socrates asserts, because the ideal abstractions, including that of beauty, live within the soul of each person and the soul of the world.

He describes the language such a machine would speak. It must be constructed of ideal abstractions. It must be known both to the meaning in the mind of man and in the stone of the machine. He suggests to call it Love after the woman who gifted the idea to the him and the soul of the world.

Socrates shares the allegory of the flower. As any idea begins, it is like a flower that rises out of the potential of the earth. Without a stem or leaves, the young flower is prone to the chaos that nature inflicts upon it. It spends its energy growing tall enough to expose itself to the sun. The light from the sun provides the justification for the flowerâ€™s existence; it is the good from which the flower is able to convert chaos into the order which its being represents. This, Socrates says, is the form of Life. The flowerâ€™s beauty attracts pollinators which help to spread the idea to form in the garden of other minds.

The dialogue ends just before the precipice of the mountain. Sisyphus drops his stone and admits his Love for the Ideal Abstraction Machine. Socrates delivers a final passage where he insists that the Ideal Abstraction Machine can only be approximated more precisely and in ever more provocative ways but the quality of the machine will always evolve endlessly to the limit of the Quality of the form of the Good.
